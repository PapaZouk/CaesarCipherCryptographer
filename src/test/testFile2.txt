So what is motivation, exactly? The author Steven Pressfield has a great line in his book, The War of Art, which
I think gets at the core of motivation. To paraphrase Pressfield, “At some point, the pain of not doing it becomes
greater than the pain of doing it.”

In other words, at some point, it is easier to change than to stay the same. It is easier to take action and feel
insecure at the gym than to sit still and experience self-loathing on the couch. It is easier to feel awkward while
making the sales call than to feel disappointed about your dwindling bank account.
