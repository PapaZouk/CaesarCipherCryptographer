Many people are afraid of flying in airplanes, but they shouldn’t be. Flying is actually one of the safest ways
to travel. In fact, when measured per mile, flying is actually far safer than driving, or travelling by train.

Not only is flying the safest mode of transport, but it is also the fastest. Just a hundred years ago if you wanted
to travel from China to the United States, you would have to travel by boat for many weeks. Now, you can get there
in less than 24 hours. Airplanes are also quite comfortable, and often offer in-flight entertainment, such as movies.
This helps explain why travelling by plane is now the preferred choice for long distance journeys.

Of course, that doesn’t stop some people from being afraid of flying. The idea of hurtling through the atmosphere at
hundreds of miles per hour can be intimidating for many. One of the main reasons that people are afraid to fly is
that passengers lack any control over the airplane, and have to place their trust in the hands of the pilots. Many
people would prefer to remain in control!

“Really?”, you ask.

Comparing the number of deaths caused by cars, trains, and airplanes is very difficult. Many more people drive than
fly. The easiest way to compare deaths is per billion kilometers. This means, how many people will die per billion
kilometers travelled? Motorcycles, for example, are very dangerous and 108.9 people will die per every billion
kilometers traveled. Cars are less dangerous, with 3.1 people dying per billion kilometers.
